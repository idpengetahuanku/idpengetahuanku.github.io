                        <strong>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</strong><br />A shepherd-boy, who watched a group of sheep near a village, shocked out the villagers three or four times by screaming out, “Wolf! Wolf!” and when his neighbors were there to help him,he laughed at them for their pains.<br />However the Wolf, truly come at last. The Shepherd-boy, now really in danger, cried in an agony of terror: “Pray, please come and help me; the Wolf is approaching to kill the sheep”; but no one paid any attention to his cries, nor rendered any help. The Wolf, having no cause of scary, at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole sheep in group.<br />There is no believing  liars, even when they speak the truth.<br /><br />^_^<br /><br />THE LITTLE PINK ROSE<br /><br />Once there was a little pink Rosebud, and she lived down in a little dark house under the ground. One day she was sitting there, all by herself, and it was very still. Suddenly, she heard a little tap, tap, tap, at the door.<br /><br />"Who is that?" she said.<br /><br />"It's the Rain, and I want to come in," said a soft, sad, little voice.<br /><br />"No, you can't come in," the little Rosebud said. By and by she heard another little tap, tap, tap, on the window pane.<br /><br />"Who is there?" she said.<br /><br />The same soft little voice answered, "It's the Rain, and I want to come in!"<br /><br />"No, you can't come in," said the little Rosebud. Then it was very still for a long time. At last, there came a little rustling, whispering sound, all round the window:rustle, whisper, whisper.<br /><br />"Who is there?" said the little Rosebud.<br /><br />"It 's the Sunshine," said a little, soft, cheery voice, 'and I want to come in! "<br /><br />"N -- no," said the little pink rose, "you can't come in." And she sat still again.<br /><br />Pretty soon, she heard the sweet little rustling noise at the key-hole.<br /><br />"Who is there?" she said.<br /><br />"It 's the Sunshine," said the cheery little voice, "and I want to come in, I want to come in!"<br /><br />"No, no," said the little pink rose, "you cannot come in."<br /><br />By and by, as she sat so still, she heard tap, tap, tap, and rustle, whisper, rustle, all up and down the window pane, and on the door, and at the key-hole.<br /><br />"Who is there?" she said.<br /><br />"It's the Rain, and the Sun, the Rain and the Sun," said two little voices, together, "and we want to come in! We want to come in! We want to come in!"<br /><br />"Dear, dear," said the little Rosebud, "if there are two of you, I s'pose I shall have to let you in."<br /><br />So she opened the door a little wee crack, and they came in. And one took one of her little hands, and the other took her other little hand, and they ran, ran, ran with her, right up to the top of the ground. Then they said, --<br /><br />"Poke your head through!"<br /><br />So she poked her head through; and she was in the midst of a beautiful garden. It was springtime, and all the other flowers had their heads poked through; and she was the prettiest little pink rose in the whole garden!<br /><br /><br />

                        <br />The Boy Who Cried 'Wolf'<br />
Once there was a shepherd boy who had to look after a flock of sheep. 
One day, he felt bored and decided to play a trick on the villagers. He 
shouted, “Help! Wolf! Wolf!”<br /><br />
The villagers heard his cries and rushed out of the village to help the 
shepherd boy. When they reached him, they asked, “Where is the wolf?”<br /><br />
The shepherd boy laughed loudly, “Ha, Ha, Ha! I fooled all of you.<br /><br /><br />
I was only playing a trick on you.”<br /><br />
A few days later, the shepherd boy played this trick again.<br /><br />
Again he cried, “Help! Help! Wolf! Wolf!” Again, the villagers rushed up
 the hill to help him and again they found that boy had tricked them. 
They were very angry with him for being so naughty.<br /><br />
Then, some time later, a wolf went into the field. The wolf attacked one
 sheep, and then another and another. The shepherd boy ran towards the 
village shouting, “Help! Help! Wolf! Help! Somebody!”<br /><br />
The villagers heard his cries but they laughed because they thought it 
was another trick. The boy ran to the nearest villager and said, “A wolf
 is attacking the sheep. I lied before, but this time it is true!”<br /><br />
Finally, the villagers went to look. It was true. They could see the wolf running away and many dead sheep lying on the grass.<br /><br />
pesan moralnya : We may not believe someone who often tells lies, even when he tells the truth.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        pada saat itu saya pergi ke tempat yg banya orang untuk mencari saudara saya yg pergi dari rumah beberapa tahun yg laluOne day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.<br />“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.<br />“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to you,” said Tito the rooster.<br />Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”<br />Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”<br />“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.<br />“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.<br />Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”<br />“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”<br />One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to mess up the party.<br />“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.<br />Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body into a ball.<br />Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.<br />“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br /><br />Maaf kalau salah :)<br />
